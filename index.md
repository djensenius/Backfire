## Backfire Board Tracker

I was not satisfied with any of the electric skateboard tracking apps out there. I built my own. It supports iOS, watchOS, and soon macOS.

### Features
* Track your current ride on your phone, tablet, or watch.
* See your current speed, distance, and battery life on your phone, tablet, or watch.
* View your previous rides on your phone or tablet.
* Grabs and saves the weather of your ride.
* Watch users track rides as workouts (you don’t burn a lot of calories, but it’s balance work, right?)

### FAQ

**Is this official**

It is not. This is a hobby app and is in no way connected to or associated with Backfire Boards. I needed to reverse engineer the bluetooth data as the spec is not provided by Backfire or Hobbywing.

**Does it work with my board?**

Maybe? I have only tested it on the Backfire Zealot S. If your board is a Backfire board and has BLE then it might work.

**Will this work on Android?**

No

**Will this ever support Android?**

Almost certainly not, it's built using Apple technologies like CloudKit. If you are feeling ambitious, I'm more than happy to have contributors!
